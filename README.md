# mos-casparcg-rundown

CasparCG client for graphics only works with https://github.com/HeineFro/mos-device-rundown 
Its a electron app, running a web server for rundown control, and uses a Elgato streamdeck via bitfocus companion.

There is a lot to be improved. 

It´s running in a OB-truck and a studio continuity on daily basis.
